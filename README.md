# Simple Python Expense Tracker

A minimalist, text-based application to track daily expenses, built with Python. This project was started as a practice exercise and is currently under development.

## ‚ú® Current Features

  * Add a new expense with a title, amount, and date.
  * Calculate and display the total of all recorded expenses.
  * Simple and interactive command-line interface (CLI).

## üöÄ Future Roadmap

This is a list of features and improvements planned for future versions:

  * **List All Expenses:** Display a formatted list of every expense that has been added.
  * **Data Persistence:** Save expenses to a file (like CSV or JSON) so the data isn't lost when the program closes.
  * **Expense Categories:** Add a category to each expense (e.g., Food, Transport, Bills).
  * **Filtering & Reporting:** Allow users to filter expenses by date or category.
  * **Delete an Expense:** Add a feature to remove an incorrect entry.
  * **GUI Implementation:** Develop a graphical user interface using a library like Tkinter to make the application more user-friendly.
