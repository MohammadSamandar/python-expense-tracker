Simple Python Expense Tracker
A minimalist, text-based application to track daily expenses, built with Python. This project was started as a practice exercise and is currently under development.

✨ Current Features
Add a new expense with a title, amount, and date.

Calculate and display the total of all recorded expenses.

Simple and interactive command-line interface (CLI).

🚀 Future Roadmap
This is a list of features and improvements planned for future versions:

List All Expenses: Display a formatted list of every expense that has been added.

Data Persistence: Save expenses to a file (like CSV or JSON) so the data isn't lost when the program closes.

Expense Categories: Add a category to each expense (e.g., Food, Transport, Bills).

Filtering & Reporting: Allow users to filter expenses by date or category.

Delete an Expense: Add a feature to remove an incorrect entry.

GUI Implementation: Develop a graphical user interface using a library like Tkinter to make the application more user-friendly.

🏃‍♀️ How to Run
Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your system.

Clone this repository or download the source code.

Open a terminal or command prompt in the project directory.

python logic.py

(Note: Replace logic.py with the actual name of your Python file.)
